# CMS Ready Template

Practice with an eyeball and it's animations.

The initial code was pulled from:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56804355/creating-a-css-blinking-eyelid-effect#:~:text=I%20would%20do%20this%20differently%20and%20consider%20rotation%20for%20the%20blink%20effect.%20The%20trick%20is%20to%20create%20the%20eye%20with%20two%20elements%20(the%20eyelid)%20to%20be%20able%20to%20blink%20it.

Goal is to change the eye to fit my design choices.
